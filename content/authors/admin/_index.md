Hi, I am a 1st year PhD student in FPGA/Parallel Computing Lab at University of Southern California, advised by [Dr. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
I'm interested in hardware accelerators, heterogeneous computing and computer architecture. I have done projects in both FPGA and ASIC, details can be found in the project section of this page or on my GitHub.

I finished my undergraduate study in National Taiwan University (NTU), majored in electrical engineering. I was also an Electrical Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Taipei.
